#  Assignment 1 

With the following Tree Diagram the four probabilities will be shown as well as the sum of the 4.

##  Solution:  

* $P(T\cap S) = 0.3*0.2 = 0.06$  

* $P(\overline{T}\cap S) = 0.3*0.8 = 0.24$  

* $P(T\cap\overline{S}) = 0.7*0.6 = 0.42$  

* $P(\overline{T}\cap\overline{S}) = 0.7*0.4 = 0.28$  

#  Assignment 2  

Using the Venn diagram above, answer the following questions.

##  Solution:  

*  What is the percentage of customers using all three devices?  
0.5%  

* What is the percentage of customers using at least two devices?  
19.9%  

* What is the percentage of customers using only one device?  
80.1%  

#  Assignment 3 

Bayes Theorem:  

*  Bayes theorem expresses a conditional probability, exemplary the likelihood of occurring conditioned on having happened before.  

Bayes Theorem Formula:  

$P(A \mid B)=\frac{P(B| A)* P(A)}{P(B|A)*P(A)+P(B|\overline A)*P(\overline A)} )$   

  
  
**Application:**    

Imagine, you are quality assurance manager and you want to buy a new tool that automates part of the quality assurance. If the tool finds a product it considers faulty, an alarm is triggered. The seller of the tool states that if a product is faulty, the tool is 97% reliable and if the product is flawless, the test is 99% reliable. Also, from your past experience you know that 4% of your products come out with flaws. To assess the usefulness of the tool in practice you want to know the following probabilities:  

1.  What is the probability that when the alarm is triggered the product is found to be flawless?  
2. What is the probability that when the alarm is triggered the product is found to have flaws?  

*  $A:$ Product is Faulty  
*  $\overline A:$ Product is flawless  
*  $B:$ Alarm is triggered  
*  $\overline B:$ No alarm  

We know:

*  $P(B|A)= 0.97$ 
*  $P(B|\overline A)= 0.01$ 
*  $P(A)= 0.04$

Compute:  

*  $P(\overline A|B)$  
*  $P(A|B)$  

## Solution:  

*  $P(\overline A|B)=\frac{0.01*0.96}{(0.01*0.96)+(0.97*0.04)}= 0.1983=19.83$%  
*  $P(A|B)= \frac{0.97*0.04}{(0.97*0.04)+(0.01*0.96)}=0.8017=80.17$%  

*These results show that in case the alarm is triggered, there is a possibility of about 19.83 % that the product is flawless and a probability of 80.17% that the product is faulty.*
