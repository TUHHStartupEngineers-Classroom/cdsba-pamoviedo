## Spurious Correlation
Per capita cheese consumption correlates with Number of people who died by becoming tangled in their bedsheets.
```{r}
library(gridExtra)
# With 10 coordinates from out plot:

cheese_consumption <- c(29.8, 30.1, 30.5, 30.6, 31.3, 31.7, 32.6, 33.1, 32.7, 32.8)
bedsheet_deaths <- c(327, 456, 509, 497, 596, 573, 661, 741, 809, 717)

# Create a data frame
data <- data.frame(Year = seq(2000, 2009), Cheese = cheese_consumption, Bedsheets = bedsheet_deaths)

# Load ggplot2 library
library(ggplot2)

# Create a plot for Cheese Consumption
plot_cheese <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Year, y = Cheese)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  geom_line(color = "blue", linetype = "solid") +
  labs(title = "Cheese Consumption Over Time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Cheese Consumption")

# Create a plot for Bedsheet Deaths
plot_bedsheets <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Year, y = Bedsheets)) +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  geom_line(color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Bedsheet Deaths Over Time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Bedsheet Deaths")

# Display the plots side by side
gridExtra::grid.arrange(plot_cheese, plot_bedsheets, ncol = 2)
